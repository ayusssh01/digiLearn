Welcome to the[ **LEARN.md**](https://github.com/ayusssh01/digiLearn/blob/main/LEARNME.md) for the **DigiLearn** EdTech project

This is a fully functional ed-tech platform that enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERN stack, which includes ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS

This guide will walk you through setting up and building your own instance of **DigiLearn** whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we'll provide clear instructions and helpful tips to get you up and running. This ` LEARN.md` will equip you with the knowledge to set up and build your own instance of  DEV-G. We'll provide step-by-step instructions and helpful tips, whether you're a coding veteran or just embarking on your development journey.

## **What You'll Conquer** <a name="what"></a>

-   A comprehensive understanding of `DigiLearn` and its core functionalities.
-   A solid grasp of the technologies powering the project.
-   The ability to:
    -   Configure your development environment for success.
    -   Clone the repository with ease.
    -   Install all the necessary dependencies effortlessly.
    -   Build the project with confidence.

## **Prerequisites** <a name="pre"></a>

-  **EDITOR** :  Have familiar with some  text editor or IDE ( Visual Studio Code )
- **Gear Up:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can grab them from the official website:  [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
-   **MERN Stack Magic:** Having a basic understanding of ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS will definitely give you a head start. But don't worry if you're new to some of these - we'll provide pointers along the way!

## **Gearing Up for Development  Setup** <a name="set"></a>

    
If you're new to DigiLearn ,  then start with 

  1. **Clone the Repository:**
-   Open your terminal or command prompt.
   -   Navigate to the directory where you'd like to clone the repository.
    -   Execute this command:



This will create a local copy of the project's codebase on your machine.
	   
	
	git clone https://github.com/ayusssh01/digiLearn.git
   
    

 Navigate to the project directory:
 
	 cd iemhacks_digiLearn
  
  2 . **Install Dependencies**:
  
 ```bash
    npm install
  ```
    
 3 .**Manage the required keys and enviroment variables  for the local host running**  :
 
> Here's how to manage links, API keys, and variables from the `.env.sample` file:

--   **Locate the `.env.sample` file:** This file typically resides in the root directory of the  project. It serves as a template for your actual `.env` file, which will contain sensitive information.
    
-- **Create the `.env` file:** Make a copy of the `.env.sample` file and name it `.env`. This file should **not** be committed to version control (e.g., Git) to prevent exposing sensitive data publicly , when you mergeing with the PR
   
  -- **Fill in the variables:** Open the `.env` file with a text editor. Each line in the file should follow the format:
    
    VARIABLE_NAME=value
    
   Replace `VARIABLE_NAME` with the actual name of the variable from the `.env.sample` file and `value` with the appropriate value you obtained from the respective website.
    
  - **Links:** For links (URLs), simply paste the URL directly as the value.
   
   - **API Keys:** Obtain API keys from the website or service that provides them. These are often found in your account settings or developer dashboard.

Suppose the `.env.sample` file contains the following lines:

```
# Replace with your actual API key
MY_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

# Replace with the base URL of the service
BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/ {YOUR SERVICE LINK}

```

You would replace these lines in the `.env` file with:

``` 
MY_API_KEY = geyv2ur7bso4y8wni { dummmy }
PORT = 4000
BASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017" { link your local mongodb }
```

    ```
4 . **Fire Up the  Development Server**:

>  It's time to see our creation come to life!  Run following Command 
```bash 
npm run dev
```
 in your terminal. This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).
   
5 .**Understanding the Codebase  :**

This section gives you a high-level overview of the project structure. We have a clear separation between the frontend (built with ReactJS) in `Main/src` directory  and the backend (built with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB) in ` Server` directory . If you're new to these concepts, don't hesitate to explore online resources or documentation for a deeper understanding.



## Resources <a name="res"></a>
